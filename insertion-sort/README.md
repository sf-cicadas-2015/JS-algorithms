Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. 

whiteboard:

create new container
shift off first two elements of the array
compare elements and add to new array in asc order
loop through remaining array and compare against element of new array
if element is less then the element of the new array then insert element at that index position.
return sorted array

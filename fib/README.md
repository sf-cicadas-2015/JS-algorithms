##Even Fibonacci Problem

I broke this problem into 3 steps.  The first step was using a for loop to iterate through an initial array with values of [0,1], then add the last and second to last element and push that value onto the end of the array with a limit of 4,000,000.  Then I popped the last element of the array because it was 1 element over 4,000,000.

The second step was using a loop to find the even numbers in the array.

Finally, I summed up the even values left in the array and return the sum.

I picked the first algorithm from Interview Cake. It turned to be quite an easy one, so I tried to make it more difficult by avoiding JavaScript built-in methods.

We start with an array containing a list of prices of the Apple stock for every minute of a single trading day. The drill is to come up with a function returning the highest profit that could be done within this trading day, assuming 1 purchase and 1 sale.

Attached is the solution to my problem in JS and the picture of my whiteboard.
